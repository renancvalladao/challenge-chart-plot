# Components

I used four components: NavBar, InputArea, LineChart and Footer.
The NavBar component contains the title with my name.
The InputArea component receives the input.
The LineChart component handles the data and plots the chart.
The Footer component contains the button to generate the chart.
There are some documentation inside each component.

I have little experience with reactJS, so some implementations may not be ideal.
